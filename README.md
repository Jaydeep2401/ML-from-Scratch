# Machine Learning from Scratch

## Contents

- A folder of specified algorithm containing:
    - A Python file with implementation of the algorithm from scratch.
    - A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to use the implemented algorithm.

## Libraries Used

To implement the algorithms from scratch and applying them, following libraries were used:

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Python library for data manipulation.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Machine Learning in Python (Used for pre-processing and evaluating the models).
